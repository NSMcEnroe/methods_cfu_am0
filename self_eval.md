# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of my focus on vocabulary and definitions.  If I am unsure of the definition of a particular word, I have gone back through the documentation to get a better understanding of the concept.  Although I am not saying I have the correct definition for each vocabulary word, I am putting in extra effort to ensure I am confident in the meaning of the word.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Methods allow us to run several (or more) lines of code just with a single word.  Instead of writing multiple blocks of code to recieve an output, you can store a methods to be recalled with ease at a later date.
